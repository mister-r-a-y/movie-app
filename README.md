This is a React App that uses a TMDB API key to display movies and tv shows.

Goals:
  - advanced search feature with an interactive filter that takes advantage of TMDB's extensive sub-groupings of titles.
  - make each title card clickable, bringing up relevant information (length, director, cast, year) and perhaps even 
    similar movies/shows.
