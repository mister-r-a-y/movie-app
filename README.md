React App that uses TMDB to display movies and tv shows. My goal is to have an advanced search feature with an interactive filter that takes advantage of TMDB's variousgroupings of titles. I also want each title card to be clickable, bringing up relevant information (length, director, cast, year) and perhaps even similar movies/shows.
