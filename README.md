This is a React App that uses a TMDB API key to display movies and tv shows.

Short-Term Goals:
  - create an advanced search feature with an interactive filter that takes advantage of TMDB's sub-groupings.
  - make each title card clickable, bringing up relevant information (length, director, cast, year)
